Challenge 2
Power of Marbles
For the more adventurous players, the game host presents another challenge.


Using the same game records from Challenge 1, determine the minimum number of marbles of each color required for each game to be possible.


The game records from Challenge 1:

5
Game 1: 2 blue, 4 yellow; 3 yellow, 2 green, 6 blue; 1 green
Game 2: 2 blue, 1 green; 3 green, 4 blue, 1 yellow; 1 green, 3 blue
Game 3: 3 green, 6 blue, 20 yellow; 5 blue, 6 yellow, 13 green; 5 green, 1 yellow
Game 4: 2 green, 3 yellow, 9 blue; 3 green, 9 yellow; 3 green, 15 blue, 14 yellow
Game 5: 6 yellow, 2 blue, 3 green; 2 blue, 3 yellow, 1 green

For example: for Game 1 to be possible there should be at least 4 yellow,
2 green and 6 blue marbles in the bowl. Any other configuration of marbles
that contains less marbles of any color would make that game impossible.


Your task is to find the minimum number of marbles needed for each game to be
possible and multiply them together. That is the power of the game. In the example
mentioned above, the power of Game 1 would be 4x2x6=48. The powers of games 2-5 are 12, 1560, 630, and 36, respectively.


The expected result here is the sum of the powers of all games. Print that number
to the standard output. For the example input above the expected result is 2286,
since adding up the powers of its five games produces the sum 2286 (48+12+1560+630+36).


Expected output:

2286

Happy coding!
